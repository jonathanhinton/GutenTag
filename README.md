# Guten Tag
A simple web app to repeat strings and print to DOM. This project will maily be a tool for epub work allowing a user to quickly populate a content.opf.  To run this app, clone the repo from the main directory then:
```
cd lib
npm install && bower install
```
This will allow you to run the program with the dependencies I have installed. I am serving files using http-server. If you have it, run `http-server` from the main directory.
